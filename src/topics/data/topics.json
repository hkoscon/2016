      "<p>With the GNOME 3.16 release in April many visible improvements were delivered to users around the world.</p>",
      "<p>While many people already excitedly use GNOME 3 with the new user experience, some feature of the new and elegant desktop like a new update notification or ebook support are not yet wildly known. We also did many things on the plumbing layer such as allowing GNOME to run Wayland.</p>",
      "<p>The talk will introduce to some of the design philosophies inherent in GNOME 3 as well as the main changes brought to users and developers. Also, since GNOME 3.16 is another step of a long lasting incrementally improved user experience, the future of GNOME's development will be speculated on.</p>"
